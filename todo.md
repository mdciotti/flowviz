## To-do

- [x] Viewbox
- [ ] Line sample density control (adaptive sample distance)
- [x] Barycentric vector mesh interpolator
- [x] Load vector mesh (PLY)
- [ ] Don't invalidate streamlines that are boundary-clipped and therefore too short
- [ ] Extend streamline to boundary
- [x] Loop detection
- [ ] Unsteady flow
- [x] Tapering effect
- [x] Continuous field discretization
- [ ] PLY Export



## Notes

- Placing samples only on the "empty" side of the streamline
